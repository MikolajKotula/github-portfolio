## Abstract

The Wine Data Cleaning Project involves a comprehensive cleaning process to enhance the quality of a wine-related dataset. Beginning with the removal of currency symbols and extraneous information in the price column, the project extends to the conversion of capacity units, correction of vintage representations, and replacement of missing values. The SQL script provided encapsulates a detailed and systematic approach to each cleaning step, showcasing the intricacies of data cleaning in a real-world scenario. This abstract encapsulates the essence of meticulous data cleaning practices and their significance in preparing datasets for accurate analysis and interpretation.

## Summary

In summary, the Wine Data Cleaning Project navigates through various intricacies present in a wine dataset. The cleaning process involves handling diverse data types, standardizing units, and rectifying inconsistencies in representations. The provided SQL script meticulously captures each step, from cleansing price information to correcting vintages and replacing missing values. The result is a refined dataset that is not only consistent but also well-prepared for further exploration, analysis, and potential machine learning applications. This project serves as a testament to the importance of data cleaning in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of datasets, particularly in the realm of wine analysis.
